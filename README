4. Clone this repository by using git clone http://www.github.com/atorisemofe/Project_1

5. In your local copy of this repository, create a new root-level file called twitter.env
        The .env file will contain your twitter secret keys that wont be shared to anyone

6. Add the following line in twitter.env, and then save twitter.env
        export consumer_key='YOUR KEY HERE'
        export consumer_secret='YOUR KEY HERE'

    (or) pip3 install tweepy
    
8. Install flask using the same process as above ([sudo] pip[3] install flask)

9. Install pandas using the same process as above ([sudo] pip[3] install pandas)

**Important** step by step explanation of python code 

    First we create an app using the Flask
    
    Create a function called index where we will randomly choose a hashtag/food from a set list.
    
    The chosen tag is then passsed into the tweepy.Cursor api search to return 5 tweets that contain that tag.
    
    We then create a for loop to go through every tweet gotten from the step above to get the text in the tweet, the author of the tweet and the date the tweet was posted.
